ABSTRACT:

Vision impairments in children are harmful to their learning process, cognitive development, social interaction, and scholar performance. In recent years, new technologies have been applied for vision screening tests, sharpening traditional techniques and enabling the early diagnosis of different kinds of debilitation on the visual system functionality. Eye-tracking is a widely used technique applied for different purposes, and when it comes to vision assessment and training, it is greatly suitable. This work aims to apply feature engineering and cluster analysis techniques within eye-tracking data collected from children performing structured visual tasks. Feature engineering creates meaningful attributes for the recordings in terms of performance and data quality, and the exploratory analysis covers different configurations for the clustering methods and their hyper-parameters. Cluster validation metrics evaluate the clustering results’ quality, and domain expert acknowledgment is essencial for trustful inferences regarding the children’s oculomotor system’s health. In order to streamline the exploratory analysis and facilitate the experiments, we also propose a framework for Cluster Analysis of the eye-tracking data.
